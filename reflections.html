This couse was one of the most interesting and facinating class i took. i never expected it would be sunch an eye opening class. I was taking the class because it was a requirment for the certificae i am working on but after taking the first 2 lessons i began to enjoy the calsses and get interested on the course too, rather that taking the calss as just MUST pass. My work depended on technology. taking this calss made me relise that everything i do throu out the day makes a seance. Also it makes me interested to see what is behind the curtains.
